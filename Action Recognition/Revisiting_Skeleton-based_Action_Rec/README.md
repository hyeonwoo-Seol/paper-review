# Revisiting Skeleton-based Action Recognition

## Abstract
GCN-based methods are subject to limitations in robustness, interoperability, scalability.

PoseConv3D relies on a 3D heatmap volume instead of a graph sequence.

PoseConv3D is more effective in learning spatio-temporal features, and more robust against pose estimation noises, and generalizes better in cross-dataset settings. And it can handle multiple-person scenarios without additional computation cost.

Hierarchical features can be easily integrated at early fusion stages.

## 결론
This paper proposed PoseConv3D, a 3D-CNN based approach for skeleton-based action recognition.

PoseConv3D takes 3D heatmap volumes as input.

Because of compact 3D heatmap volume as input, PoseConv3D outperforms GCN-based approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.
