# View Adaptive Recuurent Neural Networks for High Performance Human Action Recognition from Skeleton Data

## RNN and LSTM Overview

## Conclusion
View Adaptive Network is End-to-End Model for human action recognition.

VA Network is capable of regulating the observation viewpoint to the suitable ones by itself.

It overcomes the limitations of the human defined pre-processing approaches.

The proposed model improves recognition performance on three benchmark datasets and achieve SOTA results.
