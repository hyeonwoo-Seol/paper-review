# 3D CNNs on Distance Matrices for Human Action Recognition

## Conclusion

They presented a novel DNN architecture for refocnizing human actions from 3D skeleton data. Their approach is based on two main ideas.

First, Sequence of Skeletons are represented as sequences of euclidean distance matrix (EDM). This uses a learned transformation of the skeleton's joints.

Second, these sequences are processed using a 3D CNN.
