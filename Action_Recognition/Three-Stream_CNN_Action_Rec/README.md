# Three-Stream Convolutional Neural Network with Multi-task and Ensemble Learning for 3D Action Recognition

## Conclusion
This paper proposed Three-Stream CNN model, 3SCNN.

This model handles the three kinds of inputs jointly.

This paper designed the coordinate adaptive module to enrich feature expression.

And it proposed a pairwise feature fusion scheme and a multi-task ensemble learning network.

These take advantage of the complementary and diverse nature among multiple features.

3SCNN shows impressive performance on NTU RGB+D dataset and outperforms other SOTA methods.
