# Skeleton Based Action Recognition Using Translation-Scale Invariant Image Mapping And Multi-Scale Deep CNN



## Conclusion
This paper proposed a skeleton based action recognition method by using translation-scale invariant image mapping and multi-scale deep CNNs.

This method outperforms the SOTA methods by a large margin in NTU RGB-D, UTD-MHAD, MSRC-12 Datasets.
